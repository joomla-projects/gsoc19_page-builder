COM_CPANEL_MSG_ADDNOSNIFF_BODY="<p>Joomla is now shipped with additional security hardenings in the default htaccess.txt and web.config.txt files. These hardenings disable the so called MIME-type sniffing feature in web browsers. The sniffing leads to specific attack vectors, where scripts in normally harmless file formats (eg images) will be executed, leading to Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerabilities.</p><p>The security team recommends to manually apply the necessary changes to existing .htaccess or web.config files, as those files can not be updated automatically.</p><p><strong>Changes for .htaccess</strong><br />Add the following lines before \"## Mod_rewrite in use.\":</p><pre>&lt;IfModule mod_headers.c&gt;\nHeader always set X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\"\n&lt;/IfModule&gt;</pre><p><strong>Changes for web.config</strong><br />Add the following lines right after \"&lt;/rewrite&gt;\":</p><pre>&lt;httpProtocol&gt;\n  &lt;customHeaders&gt;\n    &lt;add name=\"X-Content-Type-Options\" value=\"nosniff\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/customHeaders&gt;\n&lt;/httpProtocol&gt;</pre>"

This will only submit the Joomla version, PHP version, database engine and version, and server operating system.</p><p>This data is collected to ensure that future versions of Joomla can take advantage of the latest database and PHP features without affecting significant numbers of users. The need for this became clear when a minimum of PHP 5.3.10 was required when Joomla! 3.3 implemented the more secure Bcrypt passwords.</p><p>In the interest of full transparency and to help developers <a href=\"https://developer.joomla.org/about/stats.html\">this data is publicly available.</a> An API and graphs will show the Joomla version, PHP versions and database engines in use.</p><p>If you do not wish to provide the Joomla Project with this information you can disable the plugin called System - Joomla Statistics.</p>"
